Abstract: Death registry is an important record that reflects the end of individual legal identities, being crucial in creating timely and accurate population census and statistics. I obtained and analyzed Torontoâ€™s death registry statistics broken down by the civic centre where the registration occurred and the place of death, creating graphs to demonstrate my findings. Most deaths occured within Toronto, with an increase in the number of death licenses registered at the Etobicoke centre, especially during 2020 to 2022, the years of the COVID pandemic. The findings can be utilized in enhancing the efficiency of civic centres.

Repository includes the license and folders of input, scripts, and output. 
Inputs contains the dataset downloaded from Open Data Toronto along with the literature paper referenced in the report.
Script contains the code used to obtain the dataset from Open Data Toronto.
Output contains the R markdown file used to produce the report, which is also included as a pdf. The references are also included in a bibliography.
Code is all referenced to the R project called starter_folder.

The best approach to the repository is to first download it, look at the literature paper. Then, use the script to obtain the dataset from Open Data Toronto. If the server is down, it is also located in the inputs folder. Finally, run the R markdown in the outputs folder.
